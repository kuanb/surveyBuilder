surveyBuilder
=============

Dynamic survey builder. (Forking this to angularize it.)


Reason
------
The goal of this repo is to provide some simple code to discuss during the 2nd round of Hacker School interviews.

Purpose
-------
Purpose of the code is to act as a "dynamic" survey builder. It should allow users to add 2 classes of objects:
1. Chapters
2. Questions
Each question should allow for multiple answers to be added, as well as the option for an "Other" entry to be included.
